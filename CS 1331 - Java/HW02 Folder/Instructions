Problem Description

Hello, and welcome! Please make sure to read all parts carefully.

For homework 02, you will be creating a calculator that can perform the following operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, and alphabetize. The operations work as follows:

    add - takes two integers, adds them together and prints out the result
    subtract - takes two integers, subtracts the second entered integer from the first and prints out the result
    multiply - takes two doubles, multiplies them together and prints out the result to two decimal places
    divide - takes two doubles, divides the first entered double by the second and prints out the result to two decimal places
    alphabetize - takes two words (without spaces) and tells which word comes before the other lexicographically

Solution Description

Name your program Calculator.java. It should work as follows:

    Perform the chosen operation and print the correct output.
        If the user is performing an add/subtract operation, prompt the user to enter two integers.
        If the user is performing a multiply/divide operation, prompt the user to enter two doubles.
        If the user is performing an alphabetize operation, prompt the user to enter two words.
        If the user inputs an invalid type (e.g. inputs doubles for add/subtract) for the given operation, print the same error message shown above.
    The program should terminate gracefully after the result of the operation is printed.

Note that 0 must not be the divisor if you are dividing. If a 0 is the divisor, print the same error message shown above and terminate your program. For the multiply and divide operations, format your output using printf.

Your program must also have at least one switch statement and one if/else statement.

For the alphabetize operation, you will be using a pre-defined String method (compareTo) that compares two strings lexicographically, and returns an integer depending on which String is larger. If a 0 is returned, both Strings are lexicographically equal. A positive integer is returned if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string, or else the result would be negative. See the example output for how the result should be printed to the user for the cases where Strings are equal.

When prompting for integers, doubles, or Strings, spaces will serve as dividers between the two inputs. Remember that when performing multiply/divide operations on doubles, the answer should only include two numbers after the decimal point.
Example Outputs

User input is bolded. Please make sure to follow the exact formatting as shown below. Note: Your program output should end with a new line. That is, after the last character of the answer or the error message, there should be a \n (you could use println, or print a \n manually - just make sure after the last line with text there is exactly one \n).

Allowed Imports

To prevent trivialization of the assignment, you may only import java.util.Scanner.
Feature Restrictions

There are a few features and methods in Java that overly simplify the concepts we are trying to teach or break our auto grader. For that reason, do not use any of the following in your final submission:

    var (the reserved keyword)
    System.exit
