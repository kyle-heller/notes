# Software Lifecycle

The software product lifecycle refers to the various stages that a software product goes through, from conception to retirement. It typically consists of the following phases:

Planning and Requirements Gathering: This phase involves identifying the purpose of the software product, its intended users, and the features and functionality it should provide.

Design: In this phase, the software architecture and design are planned, including the user interface, database schema, and other technical details.

Development: This is the actual coding phase where the software is developed according to the design and requirements.

Testing: In this phase, the software is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected.

Deployment: In this phase, the software is released and made available to the users.

Maintenance: Once the software is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance, including bug fixes, updates, and security patches.

Retirement: At some point, the software may reach the end of its useful life and be retired.

These phases are not necessarily sequential and may overlap or be iterative. The software product lifecycle provides a framework for managing software projects and ensuring that the product meets the needs of the users and the organization.
