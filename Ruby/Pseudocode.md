# Pseudocode

English like way to state an algorithm. Like communicating with someone regarding the instructions which will solve a problem.

It is not syntax though as you get more experience with a programmer your syntax will start to creep its way into your pseudocode.

1. Write a pseudocode solution for taking in two integer values and your solution should output the sum and the product of those numbers.

prompt user for first number
save input to variable num1

prompt user for second number
save input to variable num2

sum = num1 + num2
product = num1 \* num2

print sum
print product

2. Write a pseudocode solution which will take in an integer value and determine whether that value is odd or even.

prompt user for number
save input to variable num

if num % 2 = 1
print odd
else
print even
