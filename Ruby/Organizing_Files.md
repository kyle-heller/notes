# Organizing Files

In general, it's a good idea to organize your code into separate files for each class to keep your code organized and easier to maintain. This makes it easier to find and update specific classes and reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts.

For the game of Mastermind, you could organize your code into a folder structure that looks like this:

```
mastermind/
├── bin/
│   └── mastermind.rb
└── lib/
    ├── game.rb
    ├── code.rb
    ├── guess.rb
    ├── board.rb
    ├── player.rb
    └── computer.rb
```

In this structure, the bin directory contains the executable file for the game, and the lib directory contains all the Ruby class files.

The bin/mastermind.rb file would contain the code to start the game and might look something like this:

```
require_relative '../lib/game'

game = Game.new
game.start
```

Each of the class files in the lib directory would contain the code for that specific class. For example, the lib/code.rb file might contain the Code class definition:

```
class Code
  # code generation and comparison methods here
end
```

By organizing your code into separate files like this, you make it easier to modify and maintain your codebase. Additionally, you can more easily reuse individual classes in other projects if you choose to do so.
