##Minimax AI

A Minimax AI algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, where the goal is to find the optimal move for the player making the move, assuming that the other player will make their best possible move in response. Here are some of the methods used for a Minimax AI:

1. Tree Search: The Minimax algorithm uses a tree search to explore all possible moves and their outcomes. The search begins at the current game state and explores all possible moves up to a certain depth. Each node in the tree represents a game state, and each edge represents a move that leads to a new game state.

2. Evaluation Function: In order to determine the score of a particular game state, an evaluation function is used. The evaluation function assigns a score to each game state based on certain criteria, such as the number of pieces the player has, the number of pieces the opponent has, and the position of the pieces on the board.

3. Alpha-Beta Pruning: Alpha-Beta Pruning is a technique used to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated during the search. It works by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the best score the maximizing player can achieve and the best score the minimizing player can achieve, respectively. If a node's score falls outside the alpha-beta bounds, then the search can be pruned, as it cannot affect the final decision.

4. Iterative Deepening: Iterative Deepening is a technique used to search deeper into the game tree, by performing a series of searches with increasing depth. This allows the algorithm to balance between the time taken to search deeper and the quality of the decision made.

5. Transposition Tables: Transposition Tables are used to store previously evaluated game states, in order to avoid repeating the evaluation process for those states. This can significantly speed up the search, as it reduces the number of states that need to be evaluated.

These are some of the common methods used for a Minimax AI. The combination of these methods can help create a powerful AI that can play games such as chess and Go at a high level.

```
def minimax(state, depth, player):
  if check_win(state, player):
      return score(state, player)

  if check_draw(state):
      return 0

  if player == MAX:
      best_score = -np.inf
      for move in get_valid_moves(state):
          child_state = make_move(state, move, player)
          score = minimax(child_state, depth+1, MIN)
          best_score = max(best_score, score)
      return best_score
  else:
      best_score = np.inf
      for move in get_valid_moves(state):
          child_state = make_move(state, move, player)
          score = minimax(child_state, depth+1, MAX)
          best_score = min(best_score, score)
      return best_score

def get_best_move(state):
  best_score = -np.inf
  best_move = None
  for move in get_valid_moves(state):
      child_state = make_move(state, move, MAX)
      score = minimax(child_state, 0, MIN)
      if score > best_score:
          best_score = score
          best_move = move
  return best_move
```

In this example, the minimax function is the core of the algorithm, which recursively evaluates all possible game states to determine the optimal move for the player. The get_best_move function uses the minimax function to find the best move for the maximizing player (MAX), given the current game state.

The algorithm works by simulating all possible moves that both players can make and evaluating each resulting game state using a simple scoring function. The function assigns a score of 1 to the player who wins, -1 to the player who loses, and 0 to a draw. The algorithm then chooses the move that leads to the highest score for the maximizing player, assuming that the minimizing player will also make the best possible move.
