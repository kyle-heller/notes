# 01 Spring Context
- Imagine the context as a place in the memory of your app in which we add all the object instances that we want the framework to manage. By default, Spring doesn’t know any of the objects you define in your application. To enable Spring to see your objects, you need to add them to the context.
- Spring uses the instances in the context to connect your app to various functionalities it provides.
- The context is a complex mechanism that enables Spring to control instances you define. This way, it allows you to use the capabilities the framework offers.
- We’ll name these object instances “**beans**.”
