### Spring Security Implementation: Building Repositories and Services

#### Objective:

The goal is to set up the foundational elements required for Spring Security in an MVC application, focusing on creating repositories and services for user and role management. This step is crucial for enabling authentication and authorization functionalities.

#### Steps Overview:

1. **Create User and Role Repositories**: Define interfaces for user and role data access layers, facilitating database operations such as finding users by email or username and finding roles by name.
2. **Define a Registration DTO**: To handle user registration data, a Data Transfer Object (DTO) is defined, encapsulating user details like username, email, and password.

3. **Implement User Service**: Develop a service layer to abstract the business logic for user management, including saving user details and associating roles.

4. **Populate Role Data**: Ensure the role table in the database is populated with initial roles (e.g., ADMIN, USER) to assign to users upon registration.

#### Detailed Implementation:

- **UserRepository and RoleRepository**:

  - Both extend `JpaRepository`, enabling CRUD operations.
  - Custom methods like `findByEmail(String email)` in `UserRepository` and `findByName(String name)` in `RoleRepository` are defined for specific queries.

- **RegistrationDTO**:

  - Contains fields such as `username`, `email`, `password`, and annotations for validation (`@NotEmpty`) to ensure data integrity during user registration.

- **UserService and Implementation**:

  - The `UserService` interface declares essential user management operations (e.g., `saveUser(RegistrationDTO registrationDTO)`).
  - `UserServiceImpl` implements `UserService`, handling the logic for saving user details and associating default roles.

- **Role Data Initialization**:
  - It's crucial to manually insert basic roles into the role table post-creation, allowing the application to assign these roles to new users.

#### Conclusion:

By setting up repositories and services focused on user and role management, the MVC application lays the groundwork for integrating Spring Security. This architecture not only facilitates user registration and role assignment but also adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by clearly segregating data access and business logic layers. The next steps involve creating controllers to handle user interactions and further integrating Spring Security features for comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms.
